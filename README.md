# 21 Sticks Game

## About

*Project Created:* March 2019

This is an android application based on the famous game called [21 Sticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim) also known as Nim.

It consists of 2 player modes:

1. Single Player against the Application itself
2. Dual Player

I added:

- Dialog Boxes/Pop-UP boxes
- Splash Screen
- Timer in single player mode to make it distinctive in between picks.
- No. Remaining sticks with which player picked how many sticks is also available
